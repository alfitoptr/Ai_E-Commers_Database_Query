## AI-Powered E-Commerce Database Query Assistant

**Overview**
This project is an AI-powered database query assistant that helps users interact with a PostgreSQL database using natural language. The application is built with Streamlit, LangChain, and Google Gemini AI, enabling automatic SQL query generation and insightful data analysis.

The dataset used in this project is the Olist E-Commerce Dataset, which contains transactional data from a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace between 2017 and 2018.

**Project Structure**
```bash
â”‚â”€â”€ app.py              # Main Streamlit application

â”‚â”€â”€ requirements.txt    # List of dependencies
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md           # Project documentation
```

**Features**
